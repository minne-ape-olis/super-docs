# Project Super

Anyone Can Be A Hero

## The Alpha:

There are 3 main reasons people are in web 3: Tech, Art, Making money. Project Super has fire art nft pfps from the best artists on solana, is using a solana validator to power a revenue generating business, and is providing resources/research/knowledge about how to use web 3 to make money. The twist is that we're doing this with a mindset that the more we make, the more we can give.

## What is Project Super?

- an nft project and community
- a validator and yeild earning business
- a philanthropic collective and charity network

### The Vision

We believe in teaching a man to fish is much more powerful that giving him fish for a day. In Web-3 style, we are going to teach our money how to make more money using Defi strategies as well as a Solana validator. This will allow us to give slowly at first, but over a longer period of time, the impact of our giving should greatly outweigh the initial cost.

Project Super will use the power of Solana for social good by creating community funded validator and then use the profits of that validator to give to charity or crisis relief. A platform for philanthropy that is “Only possible on Solana” will be blockchain transparent as well as enable global asset transfers to places of need instantly.

### Mission

- Project Super strives to become the GO-TO for blockchain based charity giving. We will provide resources to existing charities to help them become crypto-friendly, as well as providing new options to philanthropists looking to use their money efficiently to give to charity.
- Project Super will first utilize a solana validator as a means to create revenue. Later it could be possible to build SDKs or apps to integrate with other defi products to provide ways to give to our cause as well. The three primary uses of the revenue will be to fund project expenses, compound assets in defi/validator, and give to charity through different funds or vehicles.
- Project Super will have NFTs as a way to build community around the cause. Nft’s are a powerful community building tool and solana is the best place to use them. The NFTs can be used to vote on charity distributions as well as possibly other initiatives in the community as well as discord access, merch discounts or other things.
- Project Super will be blockchain transparent. All funds used or dispersed through our charity will be able to be tracked and proven delivered. There will be a dashboard to show asset movement for transparency and legitimacy.
